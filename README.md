## Description
Neural networks have dominated the research of hyperspectral image classification, attributing to the feature learning capacity of convolution operations. However, the fixed geometric structure of convolution kernels hinders long-range interaction between features from distant locations.  In this work, we propose a novel spectral-spatial transformer network (SSTN), which consists of spatial attention and spectral association modules, to overcome the constraints of convolution kernels. Extensive experiments conducted on five popular hyperspectral image benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of SSTNs over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
