## Description
Neural networks have dominated the research of hyperspectral image classification, attributing to the feature learning capacity of convolution operations. However, the fixed geometric structure of convolution kernels hinders long-range interaction between features from distant locations.  In this work, we propose a novel spectral-spatial transformer network (SSTN), which consists of spatial attention and spectral association modules, to overcome the constraints of convolution kernels. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular hyperspectral image benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of SSTNs over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Fig.2 Illustration of spatial attention module (left) and spectral association module (right). The attention maps **Attn** in the spatial attention module
is produced by multiplying two reshaped tensors **Q** and **K**. Instead, the attention maps **M1** and **M2** in the spectral association module are the direct output of a convolution operation. The spectral association kernels **Asso** represent a compact set of spectral vectors used to reconstruct input feature **X**.

## Usage

HSI data can be downloaded from this website [HyperspectralData](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes). Before running the following commands, please make sure the datasets has been put in the dataset folder. For example,./dataset/PC/Pavia_gt.mat and ./dataset/PC/Pavia.mat

Train SSTNs with widely studied hyperspectral imagery (HSI) datasets:
```bash
$ python train_PC.py
$ python train_IN.py
$ python train_UP.py

```

Train SSRNs with widely studied hyperspectral imagery (HSI) datasets:
```bash
$ python train_PC.py --model SSRN
$ python train_IN.py --model SSRN
$ python train_UP.py --model SSRN

```

Evaluate trained SSTNs and generate classification maps:
```bash
$ python test_IN.py
$ python test_UP.py
$ python test_PC.py

```
Evaluate trained SSRNs and generate classification maps:
```bash
$ python test_IN.py --model SSRN  
$ python test_UP.py --model SSRN
$ python test_PC.py --model SSRN

```
